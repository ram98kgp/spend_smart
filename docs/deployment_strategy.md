# Deployment Strategy - SpendSmart Application

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Application Layer** 
   - Django REST APIs behind Application Load Balancer
   - Stateless design for horizontal scaling
   - Containerized deployment for consistency
   - Ex : (AWS ECS/EC2)


3. **Message Queue & Cache** 
   - Redis for Celery task queue
   - API response caching
   - Ex : (Amazon ElastiCache, Redis)

4. **Database** 
   - Primary PostgreSQL instance for writes
   - Read replicas for analytics and reporting
   - Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
   - Ex : (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL)

5. **Storage** 
   - S3 for receipt images
   - CloudFront CDN for image delivery
   - Lifecycle policies for old receipts
   - Ex : (S3 + CloudFront)


## Scaling & Performance

### Application Scaling
1. **Web Tier**
   - Auto-scaling group behind ALB
   - Scale out: 70% CPU utilization
   - Scale in: 30% CPU utilization
   - Minimum 2 instances across AZs

2. **Database Tier**
   - RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
   - Connection pooling via PgBouncer
   - Automated storage scaling



### Performance Optimizations
1. **OpenAI Integration**
   - Request batching and rate limiting
   - Circuit breaker pattern for API failures
   - Response caching for similar receipts

2. **I/O Operations**
   - S3 presigned URLs for direct uploads
   - CloudFront for image delivery
   - PostgreSQL query optimization and indexing



## High Availability & Security

### High Availability
1.  **Backup & Recovery**
   - RDS automated backups
   - S3 cross-region replication
   - Regular snapshot backups



### Security
1. **Network Security**
   - VPC with public/private subnets
   - Security groups
   - WAF for API protection

2. **Data Security**n
   - Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
   - JWT authentication with token rotation





## Deployment & Monitoring

### CI/CD Pipeline (AWS CodePipeline)
1. **Build & Test**
   - Automated testing
   - Docker image building
   - Security scanning

2. **Deployment**
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Canary releases for risk mitigation
   - Automated rollback capability

### Monitoring (CloudWatch)
1. **Key Metrics**
   - API latency and error rates
   - Worker queue length
   - PostgreSQL performance metrics
   - OpenAI API usage and costs

2. **Alerts**
   - P0: Service outages
   - P1: Performance degradation
   - P2: Cost thresholds
